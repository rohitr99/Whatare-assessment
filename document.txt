Certainly! Here's a brief documentation outline for each process:

Importing raw sample data set to a DB Collection:

Description: This process involves importing raw sample data into a database collection for further analysis and manipulation.
Steps:
Choosed a suitable database system e.g., MongoDB compass
Written a script to parse the raw data and insert it into the designated collection.
Ensured the script handles errors gracefully and logs any relevant information.
Horizontal time scale with timestamp:

Description: Data is organized on a horizontal time scale, with each data point associated with a timestamp.
Requirements:
Database schema should include a timestamp field.
The timestamp field should be indexed for efficient querying.
Plotting based on sample values:

Description: Plotting data based on the sample values retrieved from the database.
Requirements:
Utilize a plotting library such as Matplotlib or Plotly.
Query the database for relevant data.
Plot the data according to specified conditions (e.g., yellow for 0, green for 1, red for missing).
Generating a summary in tabular format:

Description: Generating a summary table containing statistics derived from the sample data.
Requirements:
Query the database to count occurrences of 0s, 1s, and continuous sequences.
Utilize a tabulation library like Pandas to organize the summary data.
Present the summary in a clear and concise format.
Writing an API for filtering data:

Description: Creating an API to allow users to filter data based on specified time ranges.
Requirements:
Choose a web framework (e.g., Flask, Django) to build the API.
Define endpoints for different filtering options (e.g., hour to hour, starting time, frequency).
Implement logic to query the database based on user-provided parameters.
Integrating a third-party API for location and temperature:

Description: Integrating a third-party weather API to retrieve location and temperature data.
Requirements:
Select a weather API provider (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, Weatherstack).
Write functions to fetch location and temperature data from the API.
Integrate the fetched data with the existing database schema.
Sample generation simulator (Bonus):

Description: Building a simulator to generate sample data for testing and development purposes.
Requirements:
Write a script to simulate the generation of sample data.
Define parameters for the data generation process (e.g., time range, frequency, sample values).
Ensure the generated data adheres to the format expected by the database schema.
Publishing code to GitHub:

Description: Sharing the codebase and related documentation on a public GitHub repository.
Requirements:
Create a public repository on GitHub.
Upload all relevant code files, including scripts, API endpoints, and configuration files.
Provide documentation, including a README file explaining the project structure, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.
